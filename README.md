# Big Data Analytics Project 
### Amazon electronic products review analysis

In this project, we are building the system using the Amazon Electronics dataset that contains  information of more than 60,000 electronic products. The dataset includes productID, Review Time, and Review of the products. 

This system is programed using PySpark and Hive environment. And user interface is build on the jupyter notebook connected with the Pyspark. After typing in the product ID, this system will output several positive/negative features and the relativity of these features.  At the same time, we can also obtain the graph that show how the scores of this product is changing with time and number of reviews. In the end, we also showed the LDA result for the positive and negative reviews.
